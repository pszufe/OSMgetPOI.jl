## Installation
If you are using MacOS, you will need to install Homebrew before installing the OSMgetPOI. You can find instrusctions at https://brew.sh/ or just run the following line of code in your terminal:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
   
To launch and load the OSMgetPOI module with Julia v1.7 or Julia 1.8.3 on Windows, Linux and MacOS: 
```
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/mkloe/OSMgetPOI.jl")
```
**Note that post installation build will trigger downloading of the [OSMfilter](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmfilter) binary file.**

## Quick start:
```
julia> using OSMgetPOI
julia> osm_file = download_bbbike_file("https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/Victoria/Victoria.osm.gz"; target_filepath = tempname())
Downloading file...
File downloaded. Unzipping file...

julia> data = get_poi_df(osm_file, OSMgetPOI.POITypes.education_school, OSMgetPOI.POITypes.transport_busstop, OSMgetPOI.POITypes.cuisine_restaurant)

## Basic information
The project consists of 2 main parts:
- `/src` directory where the source code is located. The source code contains the following key functions:
    - `download_bbbike_file` and `download_geofabrik_file` - they download and unzip .osm files
    - `get_poi_df` - it parses the .osm file from function argument and returns a Julia DataFrame with all the processed POIs. The dataframe may be used for further analysis or easily exported into CSV file.
 - `demo.ipynb` - jupyter notebook which shows how the package works.

#### Proposed POI types and osmfilter queries:

The package supports the POI Types shown the table below. To add your own POITypes, go to `src/POITypes`.

| poi_type 	| query 	|

| education_kindergarden 	| "--keep= \" amenity=kindergarten \"" 	|
